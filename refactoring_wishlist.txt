- for group registration:
	1. user lists members, this creates SubmissionGroupInvitation
	2. if all members accept, invitation is deleted and replaced
		with SubmissionGroup
	3. if any members reject, invitation is deleted and all 
		users (or maybe just the ones who accepted the invite)
		get a notification about the rejection

- in ag test result and suite result, add getter functions that return points for various things, have them take in a feedback configuration
